    "- **Practice**: Use LeetCode Database (e.g., 'Department Top Three Salaries') or StrataScratch for business-like problems. Aim for 10-15 window function problems.\n",
    "- **Edge Cases**: Handle NULLs, empty partitions, or ties explicitly (e.g., use `COALESCE` or check for zero rows).\n",
    "- **Explain**: During interviews, clarify the partition and order logic (e.g., 'I’m partitioning by region to group sales, ordering by amount for ranking').\n",
    "- **Tools**: Practice in DB-Fiddle or SQLZoo to simulate LeetCode’s SQL environment."
